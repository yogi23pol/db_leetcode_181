<p style="font-size: 12px;">
The tables are created for the LeetCode problem "Employees Earning More Than Their Managers" and the SQL query is solved with an easy-to-understand explanation inside the "Leetcode_Employee_earns_more_than_manager_181.sql" file.

The file contains the schema for the Employee tables.

The explanation inside the file breaks down the query step-by-step and provides clear examples to help understand the logic behind it. By using this file, you can easily create the tables and run the query to solve the LeetCode problem.

In this context, it's important to note that the table names used in the examples include underscores and numbers, which differ from the naming conventions used in the LeetCode problem. In MySQL, all LeetCode problems are saved in a single database, so there will be duplicate table names when we deal with other LeetCode problems. It's important to keep this in mind when working with the code and ensure that the correct table names are used to avoid potential errors that may arise from naming inconsistencies.

While the LeetCode problem uses table names Employee, the examples in this context may use names such as Employee_2. It's important to keep this difference in mind when working with the code and ensure that the correct table names are used.
